rasptimer
=========

Use Raspberry Pi as a schedulable timer for GPIO hardware, configurable over the web.

This is the software for the pool timer project described at
http://upon2020.com/blog/2012/12/my-raspberry-pi-pool-timer-why/

<strike>This should run on any Linux-based OS, although installation instructions
were written for raspbian. You just need Apache, PHP, and WiringPi.</strike>
This has been rewritten for <a href="http://indieboxproject.org/">Indie Box</a>,
which makes administration much simpler.
